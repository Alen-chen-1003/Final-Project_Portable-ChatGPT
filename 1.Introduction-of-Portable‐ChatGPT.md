Welcome to the Final-Project_Portable-ChatGPT wiki!

Our ChatGPT has the following functions:

1. **DAudio Recognition**:The AMB82-MINI can receive audio data, use an audio detection model to analyze it, and identify the category of the audio based on the items in the audioNames array. For example, it can recognize speech, music, animal sounds, etc., in a recording.

2. **Audio Filtering**:Based on the filter settings, the AMB82-MINI can filter out unwanted audio categories. For instance, if the filter value is 0, it will ignore that category of audio.

3. **Real-time Monitoring**:It can be used in real-time audio monitoring systems to detect and classify surrounding environmental sounds, which is very useful in smart home and security monitoring applications.

4. **Data Collection and Analysis**:It can be used for data collection, where the collected audio data can be tagged and classified based on audio categories, aiding subsequent data analysis and model training.

5. **Automated Reactions**:It can trigger automated reactions based on identified audio categories, such as sending notifications when an alarm sound is detected or triggering smart home devices when a baby cry is detected.
